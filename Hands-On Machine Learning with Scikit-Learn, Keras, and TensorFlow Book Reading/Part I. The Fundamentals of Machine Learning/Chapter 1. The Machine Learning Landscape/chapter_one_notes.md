# What is Machine Learning?
 
- [``Machine learning`` is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

## Supervised learning
 - In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels (classification, regression)

## Unsupervises learning
- In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled
- **Dimensionality Reduction**  in which the goal is to simplify
 the data without losing too much information
- **novelty detection**  it aims to detect new instances that look different from all instances in the training set
- **association rule learning** in which the goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes

## Semi-supervised learning
- Some algorithms can deal with data thatâ€™s partially labeled. This is called semi-supervised learning (google photos)

## Self-supervised learning
-  Another approach to machine learning involves actually generating a fully labeled dataset from a fully unlabeled one. Again, once the whole dataset is labeled, any supervised learning algorithm can be used. This approach is called self-supervised learning

## Reinforcement learning
- The learning system, called an agent in this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards)

# Batch Versus Online Learning

## Batch Learning
- In *batch learning*, the system is ``incapable`` of learning incrementally: it must be trained using all the available data
