#### **1. Intuition Behind Forward Propagation**

**Why**:  
Forward propagation is the process where inputs to the neural network are passed through each layer to compute the final output. It allows the model to predict an outcome based on learned patterns.

**How**:  
Each layer of a neural network has weights and biases that transform the input data. The transformation is non-linear, allowing the network to model complex relationships. Here's how the process works in a typical two-layer network:

1. **Input Layer**:  
   The input data `X` is passed into the network. This data can be any feature set, like pixel values for images or sensor readings for time-series data.
   
2. **First Layer (Hidden Layer)**:  
   - **Linear Transformation**: The inputs are multiplied by the weights `W[1]` and added to the bias `b[1]`. This gives us the linear output `Z[1]`.
 
$$
     Z[1] = W[1]X + b[1]
$$
 
   - **Activation Function**: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity:
 
$$
     A[1] = g_{ReLU}(Z[1]) = \max(0, Z[1])
$$
 
	 ReLU outputs zero for negative values and passes positive values unchanged. It helps in learning complex patterns by introducing non-linearity.

3. **Second Layer (Output Layer)**:  
   - **Linear Transformation**: The output from the hidden layer `A[1]` is multiplied by the weights `W[2]` and added to the bias `b[2]`:
     
$$
     Z[2] = W[2]A[1] + b[2]
$$
     
   - **Activation Function**: The softmax activation function is applied to produce probabilities for each class (in classification tasks):
     
$$
     A[2] = g_{softmax}(Z[2])
$$
     
     Softmax ensures that the output is a valid probability distribution where the sum of all probabilities is 1.

#### **2. Intuition Behind Backward Propagation**

**Why**:  
Backward propagation updates the network's weights and biases to minimize the error in predictions. It's based on the error derivative with respect to the model parameters (weights and biases). This process ensures that the model improves its performance on future predictions.

**How**:  
1. **Calculate the Loss**:  
   First, we compute the error between the predicted output `A[2]` and the true labels `Y`. The cross-entropy loss is commonly used for classification tasks.

2. **Output Layer Derivatives**:  
   The derivative of the loss with respect to `Z[2]` (the output before softmax) is calculated. This is because we want to know how much the error would change if `Z[2]` changed.
   
$$
   dZ[2] = A[2] - Y
$$
   
   
   Then, compute the gradients for the weights `W[2]` and bias `b[2]`:
   
$$
   dW[2] = \frac{1}{m} dZ[2] A[1]^T
$$
   
   
$$
   dB[2] = \frac{1}{m} \Sigma dZ[2]
$$
   
   where `m` is the number of examples.

3. **Hidden Layer Derivatives**:  
   For the hidden layer, we need to propagate the error backward:
   
$$
   dZ[1] = W[2]^T dZ[2] \cdot g'[1](Z[1])
$$
   [[Derivation of ùëëùëç1 Using the Chain Rule in Backpropagation]]
   Here, `g'[1](Z[1])` is the derivative of the ReLU activation function, which is 1 for positive values of `Z[1]` and 0 for negative values.

   Then, compute the gradients for the weights `W[1]` and bias `b[1]`:
   
$$
   dW[1] = \frac{1}{m} dZ[1] A[0]^T
$$
   
   
$$
   dB[1] = \frac{1}{m} \Sigma dZ[1]
$$
   

#### **3. Parameter Updates (Using Gradient Descent)**

**Why**:  
Once the gradients are calculated, the parameters (weights and biases) are updated using gradient descent. This step is necessary to reduce the error in future predictions.

**How**:  
1. **Update the Weights and Biases**:  
   The parameters are updated by subtracting a fraction of the gradient (controlled by the learning rate `Œ±`):
   
$$
   W[2] := W[2] - \alpha dW[2]
$$

   
$$
   b[2] := b[2] - \alpha dB[2]
$$
   
   Similarly for the first layer:
   
$$
   W[1] := W[1] - \alpha dW[1]
$$
   
   
$$
   b[1] := b[1] - \alpha dB[1]
$$
   

**When**:  
This process is repeated iteratively over multiple batches or epochs until the model converges, i.e., the error is minimized and the model makes accurate predictions.

#### **Summary**
- **Forward Propagation**: Takes inputs, transforms them through the network to produce a prediction.
- **Backward Propagation**: Adjusts the parameters by minimizing the error using gradient information.
- **Parameter Updates**: Uses gradient descent to fine-tune weights and biases for improved accuracy.
